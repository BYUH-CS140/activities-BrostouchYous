                <h3>Finding Calm — Because You Deserve Peace</h3>
                <p>Let’s be honest — life can feel chaotic.
                    There’s school, friends, family stuff, pressure, deadlines… 
                    and sometimes your mind just won’t slow down. Everything feels loud and stressful.
                    But here’s the thing: calm isn’t something only certain people get.
                    You can create calm, anytime, anywhere.
                    Calm doesn’t mean your life is perfect or quiet all the time. 
                    It means you can find little moments of peace, even when things around you feel crazy.

                <h3>The Meaning of Calm:</h3>
                <p>Being calm isn’t about never feeling stressed.
                    It’s about knowing how to slow down your mind and body when things get overwhelming. 
                    It’s when your breathing slows, your muscles relax, and your thoughts stop racing for a moment.
                </p>
                <p>Calm is that feeling when you listen to your favorite song, take a walk outside,
                    or sit quietly and just breathe. It’s reminding yourself that it’s okay to pause — 
                    you don’t have to have it all figured out right now.
