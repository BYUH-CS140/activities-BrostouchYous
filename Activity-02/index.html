            In the class, Everyone stands up, <strong>Good Morning, Teacher,</strong> 
            I am sitting next to my old friend from primary school, <em>Aiyo, Ah Touch, how do you feel for the first day?</em>
            he asked me. 
        </p>

        <p>
            Breaktime, we went to the shop in school. 
            <em>Hey! what is you favorite?</em>my friend asked.
            I respond,<em><mark>Black.</mark></em>
             He bought me a black bracelet and I liked it so much.</p>

        <p>At the lunchtime, we talked about a famous book that all students at grade 7 <ins>must</ins> for the lecture,
            <q><em>So Phat</em> by</q> by Rim Kin. 
            Then my mind was like,
             <em> Damn! I hate reading.</em>
              Anyway, I read it though. </p>

        <p> I forget to introduce my middle school's name.
            I studied at <em>Chea Sim Samaky High School.</em>
            I had a lot friends and good memories with them at school.
            I miss those times, played hide and seek, run in the rain... Unforgettable memories.
        </p>

        <p>Well, middle and high are combined
            <b>together.</b>
        When I finished middle school then I instantly studied there when I got into high school. 
        New chapter in hgih school, I had been <q>struggled</q>.
        It is hard to explain because I am not talktive as before back in time anymore.
         I am low at <ins>commucating</ins> with people now. </p>
        <p>
            My mom always said, 
            <em>NO SCHOOL, <del>NO MONEY</del> .</em>
            How does she know if there's no school? 
            I will not be gonna tell her though.
             HAHAHA    
        </p>

        </pre>

        <p>I have been growing up now since the first day at middle school. But still like a <small>Baby</small>.
        Ignore this, anyway life at middle makes me feel,<em><q>I wanna be like this forever because I don't wanna care about anything else.</q></em></p>
