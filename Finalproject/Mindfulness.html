                <p>Feeling stressed, overwhelmed, or like your mind’s racing? You’re not alone. 
                    Life gets busy, and sometimes your thoughts feel all over the place. 
                    That’s where mindfulness comes in.
                    Mindfulness is all about slowing down, breathing, and paying attention to right now.
                     It helps you clear your head, feel calmer, and handle stress better. 
                     You don’t need special tools or hours of free time
                    — just a few minutes to pause and check in with yourself.

                <img src="css/image/mediatation.jpg" alt="mediataion">
                <p>Mindfulness means being present in the moment. 
                    That means noticing your thoughts, feelings, and surroundings without judging them or overthinking everything.
                    It’s a simple way to reconnect with your body and calm your mind.
                    When you practice mindfulness, you learn to handle stress in a healthier way.
                     You can’t always control what’s happening around you, but you can control how you react.

                <h3>How Can Mindfulness Help Reduce Stress:</h3>
                <p>Mindfulness gives your brain a break from constant worry.
                 It helps lower stress hormones in your body, slows your racing thoughts, 
                 and brings your focus back to the present.
