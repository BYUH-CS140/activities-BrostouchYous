                <p>As cities grow and forests are cut down, many Romdoul trees are being lost.
                To protect this special flower, Cambodian people are planting it in schools, parks, gardens, and pagodas.
                Some groups also teach others about its meaning and how to take care of it. 
                By saving the Romdoul, Cambodians keep a part of their identity and natural beauty alive.
                Romdoul is the national flower of Cambodia.
