            <h1>KHMER FOOD</h1>

            <p>
                Khmer food, or the traditional food of Cambodia, is distinct because it is typically very mild but full of flavor, and
                 it is prepared with a variety of fresh herbs,
                 rice, fish, and vegetables. It commonly includes several "soups" or "curry" dishes made with lemongrass, 
                 galangal, turmeric, coconut milk, and fermented fish paste known as prahok. The common meal also includes rice, and is usually 
                 shared with several different small dishes for family or friends to share.
            </p>

            <p>
                Amok is one of Cambodia’s national dishes. 
                It’s a creamy curry made with fish, coconut milk,
                 and a special spice paste called kroeung. The mixture is steamed in banana leaves, 
                 sometimes shaped into a small bowl. It has a rich, smooth texture and a slightly sweet and aromatic flavor. 
                 Some versions use chicken or tofu instead of fish.

                This is a cherished breakfast dish from Cambodia consisting of rice noodles topped with 
                a light fish-based green curry sauce.
                 It is typically served with fresh vegetables (bean sprouts, cucumber, banana blossoms, herbs) to accompany the dish in typical Cambodian style. 
                 The flavor of the dish is refreshing, mild, and healthy.
                  Most locals will have the dish to go from street vendors in the morning.
