                    <b>Why is Sleep Important?</b>
                    <br>
                    Sleep is not just rest —
                    it’s fuel for your body and mind. 
                     Without enough sleep, stress builds up, 
                     your energy drops, and even small tasks feel hard.

                <p>In today’s busy world, sleep often gets pushed aside. 
                    But did you know that sleep is one of the most powerful tools your body has to manage stress?
                     A good night's sleep is not just about resting — it's about giving your body and mind the chance to recharge, reset, and recover.
                    When you don’t get enough sleep, your stress levels rise, your mood worsens, and even simple tasks can feel overwhelming. 
                    But when you make sleep a priority, you’ll notice real changes — your mind feels clearer, your energy returns, and everyday stress feels easier to handle.

                <h3>How Sleep Helps You Stress Less</h3>

                <img src="css/image/leavesp.jpg" alt="leaves">

                <p>Lack of sleep and high stress go hand in hand. 
                    When you’re sleep-deprived, your brain produces more stress hormones like cortisol.
                     Your mood drops, your patience runs thin, and your body feels tense. But quality sleep breaks that cycle.
                    When you sleep well, 
                    your mood improves, 
                    your mind feels clearer,
                     and it's easier to handle challenges. 
                     Your body feels stronger, and your nervous system calms down.
                      It’s like giving your mind and body a chance to hit the reset button every single night.
